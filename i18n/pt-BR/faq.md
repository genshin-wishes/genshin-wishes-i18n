## What is Genshin Wishes?
Genshin Wishes is a free website [with public code](https://github.com/genshin-wishes) that helps you save and browse your Genshin Impact wishes outside the game. It is made and maintained by [Colin Auberger](https://www.linkedin.com/in/colin-auberger/) and [Jimmy Vergerolle](https://vergerolle.fr).

- Backup your wishes as long as you want
- Check your pity counter on all events and permanent banners
- Browse your wishes easily with some fancy filters
- Check detailed statistics about your wishes (for the nerds like us who like figures and charts ðŸ¤“)

## How do you manage to get my in-game wishes?
We simply get them from your wish history. The wish history in Genshin Impact is a webpage displayed in the game, so even you could access it if you had the link. The only thing we need is a temporary key provided by the game. This temporary key is in the link we ask from you for importing your wishes.

## Is it safe to use?
Yes. As Genshin Impact players we are very concerned about account security.
- **We don't need you to install anything** on your computer or mobile phone
- **We don't need your Genshin account password**
- Your temporary key is not stored on our servers but **on your device**
- It is valid only for 24h, after this time you will need to generate a new link to keep your wishes synced
- This token does not allow us to authenticate on your account anyway
- You have an option to delete all data we store whenever you want (including the wishes)
- We use SSL encryption

## Is there a risk of being banned for using this?
Absolutely not. We use the same requests as the game to fetch your wishes (using open to public Mihoyo API) so there is no risk of been banned. We used it on our own accounts for months now. Mihoyo has made some [statement about third party tools](https://genshin.mihoyo.com/en/news/detail/5763), and our tool is legit.

## What language do you support?
The site is maintained for English and French, other languages are maintained by [contributors](https://github.com/genshin-wishes/genshin-wishes-i18n/blob/main/CONTRIBUTORS.md) in [this project](https://github.com/genshin-wishes/genshin-wishes-i18n).

## Will public stats be available soon?
We are currently working on an alpha version. We will release it as soon as possible.
